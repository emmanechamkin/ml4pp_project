This folder contains the work and output from MTurk, including any explanatory 
notes that I made. It also includes a log of emails that I sent to MTurk workers 
who I rejected explaining my decisions. 

The majority of the code in this folder is simply slightly varied versions of 
previously written code. Please do not regard it as new code. There are maybe 5 new lines of code here.
