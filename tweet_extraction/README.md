This folder contains the information from twitter extractions. In particular, it 
contains raw data as csvs, configuration credentials for twitter (why this repo 
is private), and the script `extract_tweets.py`, which is about 60 lines and extracts tweets from the api. 

For the purposes of pushing to github (I'm always panicked about having
credentials remotely), credentials are in the next folder, not in this folder.
