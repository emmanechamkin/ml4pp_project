Amitabh notes 
- non-traditional English --> translate emoji; only create problems when use pre-trained components 
- tag where things are from? 
- expect sentiment should be independent of whether using media or text --> assume text use is evenly distributed throughout people
- always will have a certain level of bias
- get rid of RT entirely? --> leave them in as weights
- define relevance in an automated fashion (train it in a way to figure out relevance) --> if afraid of bias in relevance, take off the shelf tweets without sentiment --> keep this


Next steps are 
- translate emoji more cleanly 
- translate links
- relevance of tweets 

Might be interesting to do a manual and automated annotation and see where you get 
different results 
- Nice to see
- Off the shelf -- can it understand Chicago lingo
- "real experience" getting to know the data is really important
- how can improve performance? Compelling story 
- people have an intuitive sense of but this has numbers

Great presentation
Should be able to have a reasonable understanding of what you're doing, 
    claim to reasonably know what you say you know
