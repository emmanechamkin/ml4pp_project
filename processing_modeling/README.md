# Read Me

This folder contains the good stuff! The processing and modeling happens here. 
This is entirely new code. Much of it was inspired by online tutorials. 

There are about 650-725 lines of code here. 

Files of import:
- `config.py` contains global constants
- `creating_clean_test_train.ipynb` contains about 20 lines of new code. This creates datasets for the modeling portion
-  `neural_net_models.ipynb` contains all of the code for building neural nets. This has been modified many times. It contains about 340 lines of code, but much of it is redundant. 
- `traditional_models.ipynb` contains all of the code for building traditional models. As the neural net file, this contains much code, some of which is redundant. All said, it contains probably an additional 310 lines of code. 
- `dictionary.json` is my dictionary
- `csv` files are specified in config and are largely the inputs and outputs of cleaning
